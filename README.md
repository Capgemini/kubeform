Deploy yourself a high-availability Kubernetes cluster, in minutes.
Built on Terraform, CoreOS and Ansible.

Our recipes for bootstrapping HA Kubernetes clusters on any cloud or on-premise.

Includes the following -

* CoreOS as the base operating system
* Kubernetes (in HA) mode (leader election using Podmaster)
* SSL certs/security for Kubernetes cluster components
* Flannel for networking
* Kubernetes Dashboard
* Sky/KubeDNS

and optionally -

* Prometheus for cluster monitoring (coming soon!)
* Fluentd, elasticsearch for cluster logging

See our Roadmap for future features and feel free to help us improve the project
by contributing a Pull Request, or raise an issue if you run into trouble!
